And what information do you use to make that decision? Selecting a model based on the best performance on a loss metric can work really well in some cases, but if you want to move from competitions to deploying models professionally, there are other factors you’ll need to consider. From December 3-5, 2019, we’re running a practical model evaluation workshop focused on answering these questions and more. During the workshop I’ll walk you through: Deciding what factors are most important for your project Training models to evaluate using different autoML systems Selecting the best model based on which factors are most important to you You’ll get daily emails with links to notebooks and exercises as well as daily live streams where you can ask questions and get feedback.

Kiri has worked as a data scientist and machine learning engineer/researcher. Her current research interests involve using unsupervised methods to reduce the amount of labeled data needed for deep learning. In 2013 Kiri was a finalist in setup.nl’s competition to create an algorithm to fake a Mondrian painting and a film clip about Kiri’s algorithm has been exhibited in the Gemeentemuseum in the Hague.

I'm working on an exciting project where we extract information from any web page using computer vision and deep learning, replacing manual spider development with machine learning. I also like doing Kaggle competitions, especially if the problem is unusual and it's hard to tell which approach is going to be the best one.
