And what information do you use to make that decision? Selecting a model based on the best performance on a loss metric can work really well in some cases, but if you want to move from competitions to deploying models professionally, there are other factors you’ll need to consider. From December 3-5, 2019, we’re running a practical model evaluation workshop focused on answering these questions and more. During the workshop I’ll walk you through: Deciding what factors are most important for your project Training models to evaluate using different autoML systems Selecting the best model based on which factors are most important to you You’ll get daily emails with links to notebooks and exercises as well as daily live streams where you can ask questions and get feedback.

About the presenter: After a PhD in physics and postdoctoral work in medical imaging, Dr. Kiri Nichol got into machine learning by tackling problems on Kaggle, attaining master status on her 8th competition. Kiri has worked as a data scientist and machine learning engineer/researcher. Her current research interests involve using unsupervised methods to reduce the amount of labeled data needed for deep learning. In 2013 Kiri was a finalist in setup.nl’s competition to create an algorithm to fake a Mondrian painting and a film clip about Kiri’s algorithm has been exhibited in the Gemeentemuseum in the Hague. Kaggle Days San Francisco held in April 2019 gathered over 300 participants to meet, learn and code with Kaggle Grandmasters, and compete in our traditional offline competition.

Kaggle Days are a global series of offline events for seasoned data scientists and Kagglers created by LogicAI and Kaggle. About Konstantin: ""I am Konstantin Lopukhin and I enjoy applying machine learning to all kinds of problems, and I really like it if the solution turns out elegant and has high quality. I work at Scrapinghub, we turn the internet into a dataset to help other people achieve their goals. I'm working on an exciting project where we extract information from any web page using computer vision and deep learning, replacing manual spider development with machine learning. I also like doing Kaggle competitions, especially if the problem is unusual and it's hard to tell which approach is going to be the best one. Recently I took the 1st place in Kaggle Mercari Price Suggestion Challenge with Pawel Jankiewicz, was 2nd in Kaggle Sea Lion Population Count, and had a few other gold medals.""

This edition is presented by LogicAI in partnership with Kaggle and sponsored by LVMH, Christian Dior, Sephora, and Louis Vuitton. Kaggle Days are a global series of offline events for seasoned data scientists and Kagglers created by LogicAI and Kaggle. About Konstantin: ""I am Konstantin Lopukhin and I enjoy applying machine learning to all kinds of problems, and I really like it if the solution turns out elegant and has high quality. I work at Scrapinghub, we turn the internet into a dataset to help other people achieve their goals. I'm working on an exciting project where we extract information from any web page using computer vision and deep learning, replacing manual spider development with machine learning. I also like doing Kaggle competitions, especially if the problem is unusual and it's hard to tell which approach is going to be the best one. Recently I took the 1st place in Kaggle Mercari Price Suggestion Challenge with Pawel Jankiewicz, was 2nd in Kaggle Sea Lion Population Count, and had a few other gold medals.""

About the presenters: Pietro Marinelli I have been working with artificial intelligence, text analytics and many other data science techniques, and have more than 10 years of experience in designing products based on data for different industries. I produced a variety of algorithms, ranging from predictive modeling to advanced simulation algorithm to support top management's business decisions for different multinational companies (Toyota, Boehringer Ingelheim, Banco Santander, Reale Assicurazioni, Enel). I am currently collaborating as a reviewer for Packt, an international publishing company, reviewing Artificial Intelligence Books. I have consistently been ranked among the top data scientists in the world in the Google Artificial intelligence platform called Kaggle reaching 3rd position among Italian data scientists and 214th among 91000 Data Scientists around the world. Luca Massaron Luca Massaron is a data scientist and a research director specialized in multivariate statistical analysis, machine learning and customer insight with over a decade of experience. He is also a published author of both introductory and advanced books on AI, machine learning and algorithms. From being a pioneer of Web audience analysis in Italy to achieving the 7th position in the global ranking at Kaggle, he has always been passionate about everything regarding data and analysis and about demonstrating the potentiality of data-driven knowledge discovery to both experts and non-experts. Favoring simplicity over unnecessary sophistication, Luca believes that a lot can be achieved in data science just by properly doing the essential.

Kaggle Days are a global series of offline events for seasoned data scientists and Kagglers created by LogicAI and Kaggle. About the presenter: Bojan was born in Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegovina, which his family fled for Croatia during the war. He came to the US as a high school exchange student, and manage to realize his dream of studying Physics. He hold a Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Illinois, and a M.S. in Applied Physics and B.S. in Physics from Stanford University. He’s worked in academia for a few years, but for various personal and professional reasons decided to leave it. A few years ago he stumbled upon the wonderful world of Data Science and Machine Learning, and feel like he has discovered his second vocation in life. He has been on Kaggle for three and a half years, and he believes it’s the best platform that he’s ever come across for learning new skills. It has been an invaluable tool in his ongoing development as a data scientist. He is a a Data Scientist at H2O.ai, where he works on various internal and external projects. Highlights of the projects and problems that he has worked on include used cars sales price predictions, insurance claims predictions, credit underwriting models, and restaurant classification based on user-generated images. He is particularly passionate and interested in NLP problems. Bojan has a wonderful wife and three amazing little boys that keep him constantly busy and amused. He is a voracious reader, is passionate about tinkering with all sorts of tools and gadgets, loves digital photography, and really enjoys hiking in the woods.
