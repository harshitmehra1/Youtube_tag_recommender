"New Workshop: Practical Model Evaluation (ft autoML) | Kaggle Sign up here: https://www.kaggle.com/practical-model-evaluation You’ve got more than one model that you’ve trained up, and you can only choose one of them… which one do you pick? And what information do you use to make that decision? Selecting a model based on the best performance on a loss metric can work really well in some cases, but if you want to move from competitions to deploying models professionally, there are other factors you’ll need to consider. From December 3-5, 2019, we’re running a practical model evaluation workshop focused on answering these questions and more. During the workshop I’ll walk you through: Deciding what factors are most important for your project Training models to evaluate using different autoML systems Selecting the best model based on which factors are most important to you You’ll get daily emails with links to notebooks and exercises as well as daily live streams where you can ask questions and get feedback.

"So You Want to Become a Data Scientist? A Crash Course for Non-Engineers | CareerCon 2019 | Kaggle The job of non-technical business analysts is changing: there is more and more data that is being used to make critical, quantitative decisions. It's becoming common for people to do a bit of computational, analytical work as part of their job, whatever that happens to be - human resources, recruiting, product management or sales. Some of those people do become enthusiasts and transition to full fledged Data Scientist roles. In this talk we will discuss what that transition entails and look at how to achieve that goal.

"Painter by Numbers | by Kiri Nichol | Kaggle Days San Francisco Kiri Nichol ""Painter by Numbers"" This is a two-part presentation: Part 1: designing the Painter By Numbers competition Part 2 (https://youtu.be/Y2pSEZC1fhI?t=889): predictions about what machine learning - and Kaggle - might look like in the next couple years. About the presenter: After a PhD in physics and postdoctoral work in medical imaging, Dr. Kiri Nichol got into machine learning by tackling problems on Kaggle, attaining master status on her 8th competition. Kiri has worked as a data scientist and machine learning engineer/researcher. Her current research interests involve using unsupervised methods to reduce the amount of labeled data needed for deep learning. In 2013 Kiri was a finalist in setup.nl’s competition to create an algorithm to fake a Mondrian painting and a film clip about Kiri’s algorithm has been exhibited in the Gemeentemuseum in the Hague. Kaggle Days San Francisco held in April 2019 gathered over 300 participants to meet, learn and code with Kaggle Grandmasters, and compete in our traditional offline competition.

"Explainable Neural Networks for Image and Text | by Konstantin Lopukhin | Kaggle Days Paris Konstantin Lopukhin ""Explainable neural networks for image and text"" Kaggle Days Paris was held in January 2019 and gathered over 200 participants to meet, learn and code with Kaggle Grandmasters, and compete in our traditional offline competition. This edition is presented by LogicAI in partnership with Kaggle and sponsored by LVMH, Christian Dior, Sephora, and Louis Vuitton. Kaggle Days are a global series of offline events for seasoned data scientists and Kagglers created by LogicAI and Kaggle. About Konstantin: ""I am Konstantin Lopukhin and I enjoy applying machine learning to all kinds of problems, and I really like it if the solution turns out elegant and has high quality. I work at Scrapinghub, we turn the internet into a dataset to help other people achieve their goals. I'm working on an exciting project where we extract information from any web page using computer vision and deep learning, replacing manual spider development with machine learning. I also like doing Kaggle competitions, especially if the problem is unusual and it's hard to tell which approach is going to be the best one. Recently I took the 1st place in Kaggle Mercari Price Suggestion Challenge with Pawel Jankiewicz, was 2nd in Kaggle Sea Lion Population Count, and had a few other gold medals.""
